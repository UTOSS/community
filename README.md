# University of Toronto Open Source Society (UTOSS)

The University of Toronto Open Source Society (UTOSS) is UofT's first student
club dedicated to Open Source. Our goal is to build the open source leaders of
tomorrow, through student contributions today.

## Divisions

UTOSS has three distinct divisions: Software, Hardware, and Outreach.

### Software

The Software division is focused on making high impact sustained contributions
to a curated list of large software-based open source communities and projects.
Currently, we are focused on contributing to:

1. Knative
1. CloudEvents

### Hardware

The Hardware division is focused on building original hardware projects in open
source. Current efforts focus around RISC-V architectures.

### Outreach

The Outreach division is responsible for all public facing aspects of the club,
such as:

1. The club website
1. The club social media accounts
   1. LinkedIn
   1. Instagram
1. This README

All of these aspects are run and managed in an open source github-based manner.

## Join Us!

To join our club, we ask that you:

1. Show up in person to our weekly meetings
1. Make meaningful contributions in whichever division you are a contributor to

As our goal is to build open source leaders, we will give strong priority to
members who are actively making and/or working towards contributions. If you
show up every week and work hard on your contributions, you will fit in and
become a full member of the club in no time!

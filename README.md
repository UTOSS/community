## Divisions

UTOSS has three distinct divisions: Software, Hardware, and Outreach.

### Software

The Software division is focused on making high impact sustained contributions
to a curated list of large software-based open source communities and projects.
Currently, we are focused on contributing to:

1. Knative
1. CloudEvents

The Hardware division is focused on building original hardware projects in open
source. The Hardware team currently has 4 main projects:

1. A custom RV32I core
2. A custom devboard team
3. A miscellaneous peripherals and cores team
4. A beginner-focused showpiece team.

Our previous projects include building [a 
simplified, pure-hardware fighting game](https://github.com/UTOSS/UTOSS_summer_2t4) for the DE1-SoC to show at clubs fair.

### Outreach

The Outreach division is responsible for all public facing aspects of the club,
such as:

1. The club social media accounts
   1. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/utoss/)

All of these aspects are run and managed in an open source github-based manner.

## Join Us!

To join our club, we ask that you:

1. Show up in person to our weekly meetings (at least 75% attendance)
1. Make a meaningful contribution to a project we are working on

Once you have completed these two tasks, you will become a member of the club.
We ask that you continue to attend 75% of meetings as well as continue making contributions
to our projects to remain a member.

As our goal is to build open source leaders, we will give strong priority to
members who are actively making and/or working towards contributions. If you
show up every week and work hard on your contributions, you will fit in and
become a full member of the club in no time!
